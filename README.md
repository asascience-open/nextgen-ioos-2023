## Creating Environments for Examples

Each tutorial creates its own Python environment and may have different dependencies. It is recommended you install Anaconda or Micromamba to create those environments. The instructions for creating those environments are in each tutorial's directory.

There are two tutorials in this repository. The first, `xpublish-exploring`, explores the features of xpublish and how to create and extend additional functionality.

The second, `cloud-data`, demonstrates different methods for accessing data and discusses the different approaches and tradeoffs available.
